# CodeIsTextIsData
Repo for talk "CTRL + ALT + DESIGN: Code is Text is Data"

## Abstract
Text and code and data are just 1 and 0s stored in a memory device. There truly is nothing special about text formats, code formats, or data formats. They are all just data. This talk will explore the ways in which text, code, and data are all just data, and how we can use this to our advantage in our work as designers and developers.

So: Code = Text = Data. Let's explore how we can use this to our advantage.

## Structured design
If you can't visualise the structure of your system, you can't design it. Visualising it forces you to think about the relationships between the different parts of the system. This is why we use UML diagrams, flowcharts, and other visual tools to help us design systems. A good design allows modularity, and modularity allows evolution without redesign. Evolution without redesign allows agility. Agility allows you to respond to change. And responding to change is what we do as designers and developers.

## Data oriented design
